- ~ I am Shizu, a girl who started her coding journey on May 27th, 2023. ~
- ~ First language I learned was C#, (still as of right now, the only coding language I know.) ~
- ~ I started learning out of curiosity and to pick up another new skill, and chose c# as its a very versatile language. ~ 
- ~ You'll likely find all sorts of stuff on here over time, games and programs for the most part. And some decompilations once I get into that (much much later on..) ~
- ~ A short list of other coding languages I would like to learn are C, C++, Lua, Java, JavaScript, HLSL, Udon (vrchat), and likely look into ps2 & ps3 machine code in some form or another ~
