- ~~ I am Chloezu, a girl who started her coding journey on May 27th, 2023. ~~
-  First language I learned was C#, (still as of right now, the only coding language I fully 'know'.) 
-  I started learning out of curiosity and to pick up another new skill, and chose c# as its a very versatile language. 
-  You'll likely find all sorts of stuff on here over time, games and programs for the most part. And some decompilations once I get into that (much much later on..) 
-  A short list of other coding languages I would like to learn are C, C++, Lua, Java, JavaScript, HLSL, Udon (vrchat), and likely look into ps2 & ps3 assembly in some form or another 




- ~~ A short list of my skills ~~
-  High Skill: Aiming 
-  Mid Skill: c# - 3d modelling - Osu! - 4k mania 
-  Low Skill (Just picking these up): Lua - 2d art - Unity development - Asset extraction





- ~~ If anyone wants to help me in learning how to extract models from various games (As a skill, I know nearly every game will be different, but the basics would be very nice to know and understand) then hmu at chloezubusinessemail@gmail.com ~~
